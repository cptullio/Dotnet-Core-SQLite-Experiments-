# Dotnet-Core-SQLite-Experiments-
An experiment with SQL Lite.
This project was created to experiment the use of SQLite with EntityFramework Core and check his performance.

I could make with this some tests of CRUD and have concluded that It can be used for small application even with a good quantity of records.
